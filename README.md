# Word Finder (*autocomplete*) Mini (*Full-Stack*!) Project

***Finding words*** in the dictionary used to be tedious and slow!
Now, its ***fast, easy and fun***!  
***autocomplete*** lets you ***easily find words in the english dictionary***!

## Why?

Learning how to build full-stack single-page apps can be laborious when the example app isn't particularly interesing/engaging, **Word Finder** is an *ultra-simple* app that will teach you full-stack test-driven-development using (*only*) ***core node.js*** modules on the backend and basic JQuery on the front-end (*no fancy frameworks*)

## What?

A ***great*** (*search*) **word finder** (*user experience*) *always* starts with ***autocomplete***. Then when the person clicks/taps on the word they want the definition for, we show them the definition ***fast***!

## How?

### Run this project on your Local Machine

#### Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/docdis/autocomplete.git && cd autocomplete
```

#### Install the node.js devDependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

#### Run the (*module*) Tests:

```sh
npm test
```

#### Run the Server with [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon):

```sh
npm run nodemon
```

## Features

### Autocomplete Module

+ [x] import a list of words into an array called words
+ [x] search through list of words for a string and return list of suggestions
+ [x] record the string that was searched for (for stats and graphs!)

### Autocomplete HTTP Server (API)

+ [ ] serve an html page with a ***search box***
+ [ ] expose the `ac.findWords` method as an API endpoint /find/:word
+ [ ] display the ***definition*** of a word when the person clicks/taps (*or navigates using the keyboard arrows - for extra credits*!) to their desired word
+ [ ] display the ***history*** of words people have searched for


# Goals (*in your teams of 4*)

## Pair 1

### Back end (*AKA "plumbers"* ... *un*-[***resilient***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_resilience) *people look elsewhere*!)

+ [ ] create an ***endpoint*** in server.js for the format: /define/:word which uses the ac module's findWords method to lookup word suggestions and returns an array of these suggestions as the http response

In your module (index.js)
+ [ ] write a ***test*** for a new method "**define**" which will return a `callback(err, definition)` when you call it in the following way: `ac.define(word, callaback)`
+ [ ] write the `ac.define` method to **request** a word definition from Wiktionary API (*requires google skillz*! - *document your finding!!*)
  + [ ] parse the result of this API request and extract the definition
  + [ ] return the *just* the definition to the client for display in the UI when client visits url: **/define/awesome**
+ [ ] expose the **searches** property of the **ac** module url: /searches/ should return a json object which the client can interpret and display

## Pair 2

### Front end / UX ([*the fun zone*](https://goo.gl/mYVqp0)!)

1. [ ] Wireframe a great word searching user experience!

2. [ ] Using the knowledge of QUnit for front-end TDD you gained in the last two weeks, build great user experience for searching words! (tip: you can build ("*fake*") the front-end (*look-and-feel*) while your back-end colleagues are building the endpoint(s) ...)

3. [ ] Display a stats (*searches*) for the words people have looked up in an intuitive and creative way!

> **Note**: even though you are running nodemon you still *may* not see the latest changes in your browser when you refresh the page...
sometimes you might need to completely ***re-start the server*** `npm run nodemon` to get the page to completely refresh ...

### Repo Owner

+ [x] Add a ***.jshintrc*** file to your project
+ [x] learn about ***pre-commit hooks*** and add a pre-commit hook to lint
your code *before* anyone can commit (*unlinted*) code. (*code quality/consistency #FTW!*)
+ [x] Learn about ***CodeClimate***, signup using your GitHub account and add badge to repo readme.
+ [x] Learn about (*Continuous Integration*) ***Travis-CI*** and
  + [x] add .**travis.yml** to your repo
  + [x] add "***build passing***" badge to your readme
+ [x] Add **Dependencies Badge** to your readme

# Stretch Goals

## Deploy to Heroku

> Ask [**@Neats29**](https://github.com/Neats29) for help if you get stuck!

## Integrate *Another API* into your results!! :open_mouth:

e.g: Search for Tweets based on the word the person looked up!
or pictures on instagram, or news articles, etc.

Figure out a *creative* way of displaying this content
without making it look cluttered or out of place. (*as always*, #***MobileFirst*** #***FTW***)

## Make the UI *even more intuitive*!

+ [ ] hightlight the characters the person typed in the word suggestions

## Search for a string of characters *anywhere* in the word!

![find all the suggestions](http://i.imgur.com/yCAcCuB.jpg)

Returning words that *start* with the characters the person typed is cool. But, what about returning **all** the words that *contain* the characters in the order the person typed them.
(i.e. ***way more suggestions*** *so that this can be used as a scrabble word finder!*)

e.g: a search for ***awe***

could return:
```
adawe, awe, awearied, aweary, aweather, aweband, awedness, awee, aweek,
aweel, aweigh, awesome, awesomely, awesomeness, awest, aweto, chawer,
clapperclawer, clawed, clawer, cockawee, dewclawed, drawee, drawer, drawers,
flawed, fleaweed, gewgawed, gimbaljawed, gimberjawed, gnawer, hawer, jawed,
jimberjawed, keawe, knawel, Meccawee, megaweber, outawe, overawe, overdrawer,
overjawed, pawer, plugdrawer, predrawer, quartersawed, redrawer, resawer,
 rondawel, Sandawe, sawed, sawer, scrofulaweed, seaweed, seaweedy, strawen,
strawer, tawer, tawery, thawer, toothdrawer, ultrawealthy, unawed, unchawed,
unclawed, underdrawers, underjawed, unflawed, unlawed, unoutlawed, unpawed,
unsawed, untawed, unthawed, wickawee, wiredrawer, withdrawer, wittawer
```

not just:
```
awe, awearied, aweary, aweather, aweband, awedness, awee, aweek, aweel,
aweigh, awesome, awesomely, awesomeness, awest, aweto
```

Making this *usable* relies on writing a front-end function
to sort the results into those which ***start*** with the typed characters, and those which merely contain them.
and displaying the results segmented accordingly.
Also it will look a *lot* better if the characters the person typed were *hightlighted* in the list of word suggestions.

**Note**: you will need to update your test for the number of
results returned by the `ac.findWords` method to reflect the wider search...
